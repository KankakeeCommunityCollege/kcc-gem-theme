<ul>
    <li>To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and the capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.</li>
    <li>To know the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.</li>
    <li>To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.</li>
    <li>To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.</li>
    <li>To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.</li>
    <li>To have their donation handled with respect and confidentiality to the extent provided by law.</li>
    <li>To participate in professional relationships with representatives organizations of interest.</li>
    <li>To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees or hired solicitors.</li>

</ul>
