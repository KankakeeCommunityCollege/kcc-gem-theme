## The POWER of Giving
{: .typography__h2 id="giving" }

[Planned Giving](#planned-giving){: .btn.btn-primary }

##### IMPORTANT: If you have a heading that matches the accordion's toggle-button it will generate the same ID causing issues in the BS4 (and 5) Collapse functionality
{: .typography__h5 }

**If you use a duplicate heading that reads the same as the accordion button's ID, you will get duplicate IDs.** An accordion 
card with a duplicate ID inside will not behave as expected.

**You need to manually set a unique ID.** For example,
the heading inside this accordion panel that reads "The POWER of Giving" needs a custom ID. Otherwise the Jekyll/Liquid processor will generate a duplicate ID that will match that of the accordion button's. Set a manual ID: `{: id="giving"}`.
