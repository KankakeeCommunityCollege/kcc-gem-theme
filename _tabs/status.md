Review the SAR immediately for errors. If corrections are needed, log into the FAFSA website and follow the correction instructions.

Refunds/Disbursements
You can view your “anticipated” refund in Student Self-Service, after signing in. You can check disbursement dates on the Financial Aid Calendar. If award funds exceed KCC costs, a refund check will be issued to you. The date of financial aid disbursement is affected by enrollment in late-starting classes.
