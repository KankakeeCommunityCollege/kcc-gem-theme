Review the SAR immediately for errors. If corrections are needed, log into the FAFSA website and follow the correction instructions.

Your Application is being reviewed by the Financial Aid Office
We've received your FAFSA and all requested documents and we are working on finishing your award package. It can take several weeks to process a file.
 We will notify you by email if further information is needed or when your awards are ready to review.
Review and accept your Financial Aid Award Package
'Accepted' status: You are eligible to receive the award. Proration and eligibility restrictions still apply. Make sure to complete all required documents.
'Estimated' status: There is a hold on the award. Check to see if you are missing any required documents. Contact us for more information.

Refunds/Disbursements
You can view your “anticipated” refund in Student Self-Service, after signing in. You can check disbursement dates on the Financial Aid Calendar. If award funds exceed KCC costs, a refund check will be issued to you. The date of financial aid disbursement is affected by enrollment in late-starting classes.
